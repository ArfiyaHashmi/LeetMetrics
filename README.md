# LeetMetrics
leetMetrics is a web-based analytics tool 
              that provides a quick overview of a userâ€™s LeetCode profile.
              By entering a username, the app fetches and displays
              >A pie chart visualization of the number of Easy, Medium, 
              and Hard problems solved.
              >The user's global rank.
              >Their acceptance rate.
              >Contribution points earned.
              The project focuses on creating an interactive and 
              visually appealing dashboard that makes it easier to 
              track problem-solving progress and overall performance.
